A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</p> <p></p> <p>Docker is build on the users hardware and runs applications in containers. Unlike a virtual machine, a container does not need to run a full operating system, making it much more lightweight and efficient.</p> <p>A Dockerfile is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to build a container image. </p> <p>For us this then becomes very useful as we can then run each individual process of the pipeline using docker images so all steps are containerized. </p> <p>However, a container starts from the image definition each time it starts. While containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when the container is removed and all changes are isolated to that container. With volumes, we can change all of this.</p> <p>Volumes provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine. If a directory in the container is mounted, changes in that directory are also seen on the host machine.
